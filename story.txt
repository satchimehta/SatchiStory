One day, a boy named Satchi Mehta walked into a gym and saw some kids playing basketball. He started playing with them and he was really good! From that day on he went to the gym every day and played basketball with the other kids. 

Satchi made a lot of friends playing basketball. He really liked everybody until one day, a bully named Mike came to play. Mike was really mean to Satchi and pushed him down for no reason. Satchi did not know what to do.
